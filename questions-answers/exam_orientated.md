If any kubeapiserver fails
```bash
Log locations to check:

/var/log/pods
/var/log/containers
crictl ps + crictl logs
docker ps + docker logs (in case when Docker is used)
kubelet logs: /var/log/syslog or journalctl


/var/log/pods # nothing
crictl logs # nothing

# syslogs:
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep apiserver
> Could not process manifest file err="/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml: couldn't parse as pod(yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context), please check config file"

# or:
journalctl | grep apiserver
> Could not process manifest file" err="/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml: couldn't parse as pod(yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context), please check config file
